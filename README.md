## Writing simplified and portable RL codebase with `TensorDict`

RL algorithms are very heterogeneous, and it can be hard to recycle a codebase
across settings (e.g. from online to offline, from state-based to pixel-based 
learning).
TorchRL solves this problem through [`TensorDict`](https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict/),
a convenient data structure<sup>(1)</sup> that can be used to streamline one's
RL codebase.
With this tool, one can write a *complete PPO training script in less than 100
lines of code*!

Here is an example of how the [environment API](https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/reference/envs.html)
relies on tensordict to carry data from one function to another during a rollout
execution:
![Alt Text](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/docs/source/_static/img/rollout.gif)

`TensorDict` makes it easy to re-use pieces of code across environments, models and
algorithms.
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>
  
  For instance, here's how to code a rollout in TorchRL:

  ```diff
  - obs, done = env.reset()
  + tensordict = env.reset()
  policy = SafeModule(
      model,
      in_keys=["observation_pixels", "observation_vector"],
      out_keys=["action"],
  )
  out = []
  for i in range(n_steps):
  -     action, log_prob = policy(obs)
  -     next_obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)
  -     out.append((obs, next_obs, action, log_prob, reward, done))
  -     obs = next_obs
  +     tensordict = policy(tensordict)
  +     tensordict = env.step(tensordict)
  +     out.append(tensordict)
  +     tensordict = step_mdp(tensordict)  # renames next_observation_* keys to observation_*
  - obs, next_obs, action, log_prob, reward, done = [torch.stack(vals, 0) for vals in zip(*out)]
  + out = torch.stack(out, 0)  # TensorDict supports multiple tensor operations
  ```
  </details>

Using this, TorchRL abstracts away the input / output signatures of the modules, env, 
collectors, replay buffers and losses of the library, allowing all primitives
to be easily recycled across settings.

  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  Here's another example of an off-policy training loop in TorchRL (assuming 
  that a data collector, a replay buffer, a loss and an optimizer have been instantiated):
  
  ```diff
  - for i, (obs, next_obs, action, hidden_state, reward, done) in enumerate(collector):
  + for i, tensordict in enumerate(collector):
  -     replay_buffer.add((obs, next_obs, action, log_prob, reward, done))
  +     replay_buffer.add(tensordict)
      for j in range(num_optim_steps):
  -         obs, next_obs, action, hidden_state, reward, done = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
  -         loss = loss_fn(obs, next_obs, action, hidden_state, reward, done)
  +         tensordict = replay_buffer.sample(batch_size)
  +         loss = loss_fn(tensordict)
          loss.backward()
          optim.step()
          optim.zero_grad()
  ```
  This training loop can be re-used across algorithms as it makes a minimal number of assumptions about the structure of the data.
  </details>

  TensorDict supports multiple tensor operations on its device and shape
  (the shape of TensorDict, or its batch size, is the common arbitrary N first dimensions of all its contained tensors):

  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  # stack and cat
  tensordict = torch.stack(list_of_tensordicts, 0)
  tensordict = torch.cat(list_of_tensordicts, 0)
  # reshape
  tensordict = tensordict.view(-1)
  tensordict = tensordict.permute(0, 2, 1)
  tensordict = tensordict.unsqueeze(-1)
  tensordict = tensordict.squeeze(-1)
  # indexing
  tensordict = tensordict[:2]
  tensordict[:, 2] = sub_tensordict
  # device and memory location
  tensordict.cuda()
  tensordict.to("cuda:1")
  tensordict.share_memory_()
  ```
  </details>

TensorDict comes with a dedicated [`tensordict.nn`](https://pytorch.github.io/tensordict/reference/nn.html)
module that contains everything you might need to write your model with it.
And it is `functorch` and `torch.compile` compatible!

  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```diff
  transformer_model = nn.Transformer(nhead=16, num_encoder_layers=12)
  + td_module = SafeModule(transformer_model, in_keys=["src", "tgt"], out_keys=["out"])
  src = torch.rand((10, 32, 512))
  tgt = torch.rand((20, 32, 512))
  + tensordict = TensorDict({"src": src, "tgt": tgt}, batch_size=[20, 32])
  - out = transformer_model(src, tgt)
  + td_module(tensordict)
  + out = tensordict["out"]
  ```

  The `TensorDictSequential` class allows to branch sequences of `nn.Module` instances in a highly modular way.
  For instance, here is an implementation of a transformer using the encoder and decoder blocks:
  ```python
  encoder_module = TransformerEncoder(...)
  encoder = TensorDictSequential(encoder_module, in_keys=["src", "src_mask"], out_keys=["memory"])
  decoder_module = TransformerDecoder(...)
  decoder = TensorDictModule(decoder_module, in_keys=["tgt", "memory"], out_keys=["output"])
  transformer = TensorDictSequential(encoder, decoder)
  assert transformer.in_keys == ["src", "src_mask", "tgt"]
  assert transformer.out_keys == ["memory", "output"]
  ```

  `TensorDictSequential` allows to isolate subgraphs by querying a set of desired input / output keys:
  ```python
  transformer.select_subsequence(out_keys=["memory"])  # returns the encoder
  transformer.select_subsequence(in_keys=["tgt", "memory"])  # returns the decoder
  ```

## Features

- A common [interface for environments](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/envs)
  which supports common libraries (OpenAI gym, deepmind control lab, etc.)<sup>(1)</sup> and state-less execution 
  (e.g. Model-based environments).
  The [batched environments](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/envs/batched_envs.py) containers allow parallel execution<sup>(2)</sup>.
  A common PyTorch-first class of [tensor-specification class](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/data/tensor_specs.py) is also provided.
  TorchRL's environments API is simple but stringent and specific. Check the 
  [documentation](https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/reference/envs.html)
  and [tutorial](https://pytorch.org/rl/stable/tutorials/pendulum.html) to learn more!
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  env_make = lambda: GymEnv("Pendulum-v1", from_pixels=True)
  env_parallel = ParallelEnv(4, env_make)  # creates 4 envs in parallel
  tensordict = env_parallel.rollout(max_steps=20, policy=None)  # random rollout (no policy given)
  assert tensordict.shape == [4, 20]  # 4 envs, 20 steps rollout
  env_parallel.action_spec.is_in(tensordict["action"])  # spec check returns True
  ```
  </details>

- multiprocess and distributed [data collectors](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/collectors/collectors.py)<sup>(2)</sup>
  that work synchronously or asynchronously.
  Through the use of TensorDict, TorchRL's training loops are made very similar
  to regular training loops in supervised
  learning (although the "dataloader" -- read data collector -- is modified on-the-fly):
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  env_make = lambda: GymEnv("Pendulum-v1", from_pixels=True)
  collector = MultiaSyncDataCollector(
      [env_make, env_make],
      policy=policy,
      devices=["cuda:0", "cuda:0"],
      total_frames=10000,
      frames_per_batch=50,
      ...
  )
  for i, tensordict_data in enumerate(collector):
      loss = loss_module(tensordict_data)
      loss.backward()
      optim.step()
      optim.zero_grad()
      collector.update_policy_weights_()
  ```
  </details>

  Check our [distributed collector examples](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/examples/distributed/collectors) to
  learn more about ultra-fast data collection with TorchRL.

- efficient<sup>(2)</sup> and generic<sup>(1)</sup> [replay buffers](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/data/replay_buffers/replay_buffers.py) with modularized storage:
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  storage = LazyMemmapStorage(  # memory-mapped (physical) storage
      cfg.buffer_size,
      scratch_dir="/tmp/"
  )
  buffer = TensorDictPrioritizedReplayBuffer(
      alpha=0.7,
      beta=0.5,
      collate_fn=lambda x: x,
      pin_memory=device != torch.device("cpu"),
      prefetch=10,  # multi-threaded sampling
      storage=storage
  )
  ```
  </details>

  Replay buffers are also offered as wrappers around common datasets for *offline RL*:
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  from torchrl.data.replay_buffers import SamplerWithoutReplacement
  from torchrl.data.datasets.d4rl import D4RLExperienceReplay
  data = D4RLExperienceReplay(
      "maze2d-open-v0",
      split_trajs=True,
      batch_size=128,
      sampler=SamplerWithoutReplacement(drop_last=True),
  )
  for sample in data:  # or alternatively sample = data.sample()
      fun(sample)
  ```
  </details>


- cross-library [environment transforms](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/envs/transforms/transforms.py)<sup>(1)</sup>,
  executed on device and in a vectorized fashion<sup>(2)</sup>,
  which process and prepare the data coming out of the environments to be used by the agent:
  <details>
    <summary>Code</summary>

  ```python
  env_make = lambda: GymEnv("Pendulum-v1", from_pixels=True)
  env_base = ParallelEnv(4, env_make, device="cuda:0")  # creates 4 envs in parallel
  env = TransformedEnv(
      env_base,
      Compose(
          ToTensorImage(),
          ObservationNorm(loc=0.5, scale=1.0)),  # executes the transforms once and on device
  )
  tensordict = env.reset()
  assert tensordict.device == torch.device("cuda:0")
  ```
  Other transforms include: reward scaling (`RewardScaling`), shape operations (concatenation of tensors, unsqueezing etc.), concatenation of
  successive operations (`CatFrames`), resizing (`Resize`) and many more.

  Unlike other libraries, the transforms are stacked as a list (and not wrapped in each other), which makes it
  easy to add and remove them at will:
  ```python
  env.insert_transform(0, NoopResetEnv())  # inserts the NoopResetEnv transform at the index 0
  ```
  Nevertheless, transforms can access and execute operations on the parent environment:
  ```python
  transform = env.transform[1]  # gathers the second transform of the list
  parent_env = transform.parent  # returns the base environment of the second transform, i.e. the base env + the first transform
  ```
  </details>

- various tools for distributed learning (e.g. [memory mapped tensors](https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict/blob/main/tensordict/memmap.py))<sup>(2)</sup>;
- various [architectures](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/modules/models/) and models (e.g. [actor-critic](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/torchrl/modules/tensordict_module/actors.py))<sup>(1)</sup>:

```

## Installation

### Create a new virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv torchrl
source torchrl/bin/activate  # On Windows use: venv\Scripts\activate
```

Or create a conda environment where the packages will be installed.

```
conda create --name torchrl python=3.9
conda activate torchrl
```

### Install dependencies:

#### PyTorch

Depending on the use of torchrl that you want to make, you may want to 
install the latest (nightly) PyTorch release or the latest stable version of PyTorch.
See [here](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) for a detailed list of commands, 
including `pip3` or other special installation instructions.

TorchRL offers a few pre-defined dependencies such as `"torchrl[tests]"`, `"torchrl[atari]"` etc. 

#### Torchrl

You can install the **latest stable release** by using
```bash
pip3 install torchrl
```
This should work on linux (including AArch64 machines), Windows 10 and OsX (Metal chips only).
On certain Windows machines (Windows 11), one should build the library locally.
This can be done in two ways:

```bash
# Install and build locally v0.8.1 of the library without cloning
pip3 install git+https://github.com/pytorch/rl@v0.8.1
# Clone the library and build it locally
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/tensordict
git clone https://github.com/pytorch/rl
pip install -e tensordict
pip install -e rl
```

Note that tensordict local build requires `cmake` to be installed via [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (MacOS) or another package manager
such as `apt`, `apt-get`, `conda` or `yum` but NOT `pip`, as well as `pip install "pybind11[global]"`.   

One can also build the wheels to distribute to co-workers using
```bash
python setup.py bdist_wheel
```
Your wheels will be stored there `./dist/torchrl<name>.whl` and installable via
```bash
pip install torchrl<name>.whl
```

The **nightly build** can be installed via
```bash
pip3 install tensordict-nightly torchrl-nightly
```
which we currently only ship for Linux machines.
Importantly, the nightly builds require the nightly builds of PyTorch too.
Also, a local build of torchrl with the nightly build of tensordict may fail - install both nightlies or both local builds but do not mix them.


**Disclaimer**: As of today, TorchRL is roughly compatible with any pytorch version >= 2.1 and installing it will not
directly require a newer version of pytorch to be installed. Indirectly though, tensordict still requires the latest
PyTorch to be installed and we are working hard to loosen that requirement. 
The C++ binaries of TorchRL (mainly for prioritized replay buffers) will only work with PyTorch 2.7.0 and above.
Some features (e.g., working with nested jagged tensors) may also
be limited with older versions of pytorch. It is recommended to use the latest TorchRL with the latest PyTorch version
unless there is a strong reason not to do so.

**Optional dependencies**

The following libraries can be installed depending on the usage one wants to
make of torchrl:
```
# diverse
pip3 install tqdm tensorboard "hydra-core>=1.1" hydra-submitit-launcher

# rendering
pip3 install "moviepy<2.0.0"

# deepmind control suite
pip3 install dm_control

# gym, atari games
pip3 install "gym[atari]" "gym[accept-rom-license]" pygame

# tests
pip3 install pytest pyyaml pytest-instafail

# tensorboard
pip3 install tensorboard

# wandb
pip3 install wandb
```

Versioning issues can cause error message of the type ```undefined symbol```
and such. For these, refer to the [versioning issues document](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/knowledge_base/VERSIONING_ISSUES.md)
for a complete explanation and proposed workarounds.

## Asking a question

If you spot a bug in the library, please raise an issue in this repo.

If you have a more generic question regarding RL in PyTorch, post it on
the [PyTorch forum](https://discuss.pytorch.org/c/reinforcement-learning/6).

## Contributing

Internal collaborations to torchrl are welcome! Feel free to fork, submit issues and PRs.
You can checkout the detailed contribution guide [here](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).
As mentioned above, a list of open contributions can be found in [here](https://github.com/pytorch/rl/issues/509).

Contributors are recommended to install [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) (using `pre-commit install`). pre-commit will check for linting related issues when the code is committed locally. You can disable th check by appending `-n` to your commit command: `git commit -m <commit message> -n`
