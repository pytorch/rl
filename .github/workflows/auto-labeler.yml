# Automatically add labels to PRs based on which files changed
#
# This complements auto-tag.yml (title-based labeling):
# - auto-tag.yml: Labels based on PR title prefix ([BugFix], [Feature], etc.)
# - auto-labeler.yml: Labels based on which files/directories changed
#
# Together they provide complete PR categorization:
# - Title-based labels capture the INTENT (bug fix, feature, etc.)
# - File-based labels capture the SCOPE (which components changed)
