# Distributed data collection examples

If your algorithm is bound by the data collection speed, you may consider using
distributed data collector to make your training faster.
TorchRL offers a bunch of distributed data collectors that you can use
to increase the collection speed tenfold or more.

These examples are divided in a single machine and a multi-node series.

Refer to the [documentation](https://pytorch.org/rl/reference/collectors.html)
for more insight on what you can expect do
and how these tools should be used.
