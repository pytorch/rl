# A2C Example Results

## MuJoCo HalfCheetah Environment

We tested the A2C algorithm on the MuJoCo HalfCheetah environment. The hyperparameters used for the training are specified in the config_example2.yaml file and are also the same as those used in the original PPO paper. However, this implementation uses a shared policy-value architecture.
