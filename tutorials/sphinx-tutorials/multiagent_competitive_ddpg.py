Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (DDPG) with TorchRL Tutorial
===========================================================================
**Author**: `Matteo Bettini <https://github.com/matteobettini>`_

.. note::

   If you are interested in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) in
   TorchRL, check out
   `BenchMARL <https://github.com/facebookresearch/BenchMARL>`__: a benchmarking library where you
   can train and compare MARL sota-implementations, tasks, and models using TorchRL!

This tutorial demonstrates how to use PyTorch and TorchRL to
solve a Competitive Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) problem.

For ease of use, this tutorial will follow the general structure of the already available :doc:`/tutorials/multiagent_ppo`.

In this tutorial, we will use the *simple_tag* environment from the
`MADDPG paper <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275>`__. This environment is part
of a set called `MultiAgentParticleEnvironments (MPE) <https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs>`__
introduced with the paper.

There are currently multiple simulators providing MPE environments.
In this tutorial we show how to train this environment in TorchRL using either:

- `PettingZoo <https://pettingzoo.farama.org/>`__, in the traditional CPU version of the environment;
- `VMAS <https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator>`__, which provides a vectorized implementation in PyTorch,
  able to simulate multiple environments on a GPU to speed up computation.

Key learnings:

- How to use competitive multi-agent environments in TorchRL, how their specs work, and how they integrate with the library;
- How to use Parallel PettingZoo and VMAS environments with multiple agent groups in TorchRL;
- How to create different multi-agent network architectures in TorchRL (e.g., using parameter sharing, centralised critic)
- How we can use :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` to carry multi-agent multi-group data;
- How we can tie all the library components (collectors, modules, replay buffers, and losses) in an off-policy multi-agent MADDPG/IDDPG training loop.

#    Off-policy learning
#
# This approach has been extended to multi-agent learning in `Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275>`__,
# which introduces the Multi Agent DDPG (MADDPG) algorithm.
# In multi-agent settings, things are a bit different. We now have multiple policies :math:`\mathbf{\pi}`,
# one for each agent. Policies are typically local and decentralised. This means that
# the policy for a single agent will output an action for that agent based only on its observation.
# In the MARL literature, this is referred to as **decentralised execution**.
# On the other hand, different formulations exist for the critic, mainly:
#
# - In `MADDPG <https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275>`_ the critic is centralised and takes as input the global state and global action
#   of the system. The global state can be a global observation or simply the concatenation of the agents' observation.
#   The global action is the concatenation of agent actions. MADDPG
#   can be used in contexts where **centralised training** is performed as it needs access to global information.
# - In IDDPG, the critic takes as input just the observation and action of one agent.
#   This allows **decentralised training** as both the critic and the policy will only need local
#   information to compute their outputs.
#
# Centralised critics help overcome the non-stationary of multiple agents learning concurrently, but,
# on the other hand, they may be impacted by their large input space.
# In this tutorial, we will be able to train both formulations, and we will also discuss how
# parameter-sharing (the practice of sharing the network parameters across the agents) impacts each.
#
# The structure of this tutorial is as follows:
#
# 1. Initially, we will establish a set of hyperparameters for use.
#
# 2. Subsequently, we will construct a multi-agent environment, utilizing TorchRL's
#    wrapper for either PettingZoo or VMAS.
#
# 3. Following that, we will formulate the policy and critic networks, discussing the effects of various choices on
#    parameter sharing and critic centralisation.
#
# 4. Afterwards, we will create the sampling collector and the replay buffer.
#
# 5. In the end, we will execute our training loop and examine the outcomes.
#
# If you are operating this in Colab or on a machine with a GUI, you will also have the opportunity
# to render and visualize your own trained policy before and after the training process.

# Environment
# -----------
#
# Multi-agent environments simulate multiple agents interacting with the world.
# TorchRL API allows integrating various types of multi-agent environment flavours.
# In this tutorial we will focus on environments where multiple agent groups interact in parallel.
# That is: at every step all agents will get an observation and take an action synchronously.
#
# Furthermore, the TorchRL MARL API allows to separate agents into groups. Each group will be a separate entry in the
# tensordict. The data of agents within a group is stacked together. Therefore, by choosing how to group your agents,
# you can decide which data is stacked/kept as separate entries.
# The grouping strategy can be specified at construction in environments like VMAS and PettingZoo.
# For more info on grouping, see :class:`~torchrl.envs.utils.MarlGroupMapType`.
#
# In the *simple_tag* environment
# there are two teams of agents: the chasers (or "adversaries") (red circles) and the evaders (or "agents") (green circles).
# Chasers are rewarded for touching evaders (+10).
# Upon a contact the team of chasers is collectively rewarded and the
# evader touched is penalized with the same value (-10).
# Evaders have higher speed and acceleration than chasers.
# In the environment there are also obstacles (black circles).
# Agents and obstacles are spawned according to a uniform random distribution.
# Agents act in a 2D continuous world with drag and elastic collisions.
# Their actions are 2D continuous forces which determine their acceleration.
# Each agent observes its position,
# velocity, relative positions to all other agents and obstacles, and velocities of evaders.
#
# The PettingZoo and VMAS versions differ slightly in the reward functions as PettingZoo penalizes evaders for going
# out-of-bounds, while VMAS impedes it physically. This is the reason why you will observe that in VMAS the rewards of the
# two teams are identical, just with opposite sign, while in PettingZoo the evaders will have lower rewards.
#
# We will now instantiate the environment.
# For this tutorial, we will limit the episodes to ``max_steps``, after which the terminated flag is set. This is
# functionality is already provided in the PettingZoo and VMAS simulators but the TorchRL :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter`
# transform could alternatively be used.

# Group map
# ~~~~~~~~~
#
# PettingZoo and VMAS environments use the TorchRL MARL grouping API.
# We can access the group map, mapping each group to the agents in it, as follows:
#

print(f"group_map: {base_env.group_map}")

######################################################################
# as we can see it contains 2 groups: "agents" (evaders) and "adversaries" (chasers).
#
# The environment is not only defined by its simulator and transforms, but also
# by a series of metadata that describe what can be expected during its
# execution.
# For efficiency purposes, TorchRL is quite stringent when it comes to
# environment specs, but you can easily check that your environment specs are
# adequate.
# In our example, the simulator wrapper takes care of setting the proper specs for your base_env, so
# you should not have to care about this.
#
# There are four specs to look at:
#
# - ``action_spec`` defines the action space;
# - ``reward_spec`` defines the reward domain;
# - ``done_spec`` defines the done domain;
# - ``observation_spec`` which defines the domain of all other outputs from environment steps;
#
#

print("action_spec:", base_env.full_action_spec)
print("reward_spec:", base_env.full_reward_spec)
print("done_spec:", base_env.full_done_spec)
print("observation_spec:", base_env.observation_spec)

######################################################################
# Using the commands just shown we can access the domain of each value.
#
# We can see that all specs are structured as a dictionary, with the root always containing the group names.
# This structure will be followed in all tensordict data coming and going to the environment.
# Furthermore, the specs of each group have leading shape ``(n_agents_in_that_group)`` (1 for agents, 2 for adversaries),
# meaning that the tensor data of that group will always have that leading shape (agents within a group have the data stacked).
#
# Looking at the ``done_spec``, we can see that there are some keys that are outside of agent groups
# (``"done", "terminated", "truncated"``), which do not have a leading multi-agent dimension.
# These keys are shared by all agents and represent the environment global done state used for resetting.
# By default, like in this case, parallel PettingZoo environments are done when any agent is done, but this behaviour
# can be overridden by setting ``done_on_any`` at PettingZoo environment construction.
#
# To quickly access the keys for each of these values in tensordicts, we can simply ask the environment for the
# respective keys, and
# we will immediately understand which are per-agent and which shared.
# This info will be useful in order to tell all other TorchRL components where to find each value
#

print("action_keys:", base_env.action_keys)
print("reward_keys:", base_env.reward_keys)
print("done_keys:", base_env.done_keys)


######################################################################
# Transforms
# ~~~~~~~~~~
#
# We can append any TorchRL transform we need to our environment.
# These will modify its input/output in some desired way.
# We stress that, in multi-agent contexts, it is paramount to provide explicitly the keys to modify.
#
# For example, in this case, we will instantiate a ``RewardSum`` transform which will sum rewards over the episode.
# We will tell this transform where to find the reset keys for each reward key.
# Essentially we just say that the
# episode reward of each group should be reset when the ``"_reset"`` tensordict key is set, meaning that ``env.reset()``
# was called.
# The transformed environment will inherit
# the device and meta-data of the wrapped environment, and transform these depending on the sequence
# of transforms it contains.
#

env = TransformedEnv(
    base_env,
    RewardSum(
        in_keys=base_env.reward_keys,

)

# the :func:`check_env_specs` function runs a small rollout and compares its output against the environment
# specs. If no error is raised, we can be confident that the specs are properly defined:
#
check_env_specs(env)

######################################################################
# Rollout
# ~~~~~~~
#
# For fun, let us see what a simple random rollout looks like. You can
# call `env.rollout(n_steps)` and get an overview of what the environment inputs
# and outputs look like. Actions will automatically be drawn at random from the action spec
# domain.
#
n_rollout_steps = 5
rollout = env.rollout(n_rollout_steps)
print(f"rollout of {n_rollout_steps} steps:", rollout)
print("Shape of the rollout TensorDict:", rollout.batch_size)

######################################################################
# We can see that our rollout has ``batch_size`` of ``(n_rollout_steps)``.
# This means that all the tensors in it will have this leading dimension.
#
# Looking more in depth, we can see that the output tensordict can be divided in the following way:
#
# - *In the root* (accessible by running ``rollout.exclude("next")`` ) we will find all the keys that are available
#   after a reset is called at the first timestep. We can see their evolution through the rollout steps by indexing
#   the ``n_rollout_steps`` dimension. Among these keys, we will find the ones that are different for each agent
#   in the ``rollout[group_name]`` tensordicts, which will have batch size ``(n_rollout_steps, n_agents_in_group)``
#   signifying that it is storing the additional agent dimension. The ones outside the group tensordicts
#   will be the shared ones.
# - *In the next* (accessible by running ``rollout.get("next")`` ). We will find the same structure as the root with some minor differences highlighted below.
#
# In TorchRL the convention is that done and observations will be present in both root and next (as these are
# available both at reset time and after a step). Action will only be available in root (as there is no action
# resulting from a step) and reward will only be available in next (as there is no reward at reset time).
# This structure follows the one in **Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton and Barto)** where root represents data at time :math:`t` and
# next represents data at time :math:`t+1` of a world step.
#
#
# Render a random rollout
# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#
# If you are on Google Colab, or on a machine with OpenGL and a GUI, you can actually render a random rollout.
# This will give you an idea of what a random policy will achieve in this task, in order to compare it
# with the policy you will train yourself!
#
# To render a rollout, follow the instructions in the *Render* section at the end of this tutorial
# and just remove the line ``policy=agents_exploration_policy`` from ``env.rollout()``.
#
#
# Policy
# ------
#
# DDPG utilises a deterministic policy. This means that our
# neural network will output the action to take.
# As the action is continuous, we use a Tanh-Delta distribution to respect the
# action space boundaries. The only thing that this class does is apply a Tanh transformation to make sure the action
# is withing the domain bounds.
#
# Another important decision we need to make is whether we want the agents within a team to **share the policy parameters**.
# On the one hand, sharing parameters means that they will all share the same policy, which will allow them to benefit from
# each other's experiences. This will also result in faster training.
# On the other hand, it will make them behaviourally *homogenous*, as they will in fact share the same model.
# For this example, we will enable sharing as we do not mind the homogeneity and can benefit from the computational
# speed, but it is important to always think about this decision in your own problems!
#
# We design the policy in three steps.
#
# **First**: define a neural network ``n_obs_per_agent`` -> ``n_actions_per_agents``
#
# For this we use the ``MultiAgentMLP``, a TorchRL module made exactly for
# multiple agents, with much customisation available.
#
# We will define a different policy for each group and store them in a dictionary.
#
#

# parameters. We also provide the minimum and maximum values of this
# distribution, which we gather from the environment specs.

# **Third**: Exploration
#
# Since the DDPG policy is deterministic, we need a way to perform exploration during collection.
#
# For this purpose, we need to append an exploration layer to our policies before passing them to the collector.
# In this case we use a :class:`~torchrl.modules.AdditiveGaussianWrapper`, which adds gaussian noise to our action
# (and clamps it if the noise makes the action out of bounds).
#
# This exploration wrapper uses a ``sigma`` parameter which is multiplied by the noise to determine its magnitude.
# Sigma can be annealed throughout training to reduce exploration.
# Sigma will go from ``sigma_init`` to ``sigma_end`` in ``annealing_num_steps``.

# Critic network
# --------------
#
# The critic network is a crucial component of the DDPG algorithm, even though it
# isn't used at sampling time. This module will read the observations & actions taken and
# return the corresponding value estimates.
#
# As before, one should think carefully about the decision of **sharing the critic parameters** within an agent group.
# In general, parameter sharing will grant faster training convergence, but there are a few important
# considerations to be made:
#
# - Sharing is not recommended when agents have different reward functions, as the critics will need to learn
#   to assign different values to the same state (e.g., in mixed cooperative-competitive settings).
#   In this case, since the two groups are already using separate networks, the sharing decision only applies
#   for agents within a group, which we already know have the same reward function.
# - In decentralised training settings, sharing cannot be performed without additional infrastructure to
#   synchronise parameters.
#
# In all other cases where the reward function (to be differentiated from the reward) is the same for all agents
# in a group (as in the current scenario),
# sharing can provide improved performance. This can come at the cost of homogeneity in the agent strategies.
# In general, the best way to know which choice is preferable is to quickly experiment both options.
#
# Here is also where we have to choose between **MADDPG and IDDPG**:
#
# - With MADDPG, we will obtain a central critic with full-observability
#   (i.e., it will take all the concatenated global agent observations and actions as input).
#   We can do this because we are in a simulator
#   and training is centralised.
# - With IDDPG, we will have a local decentralised critic, just like the policy.
#
# In any case, the critic output will have shape ``(..., n_agents_in_group, 1)``.
# If the critic is centralised and shared,
# all the values along the ``n_agents_in_group`` dimension will be identical.
#
# As with the policy, we create a critic network for each group and store them in a dictionary.

# Data collector
# --------------
#
# TorchRL provides a set of data collector classes. Briefly, these
# classes execute three operations: reset an environment, compute an action
# using the policy and the latest observation, execute a step in the environment, and repeat
# the last two steps until the environment signals a stop (or reaches a done
# state).
#
# We will use the simplest possible data collector, which has the same output as an environment rollout,
# with the only difference that it will auto reset done states until the desired frames are collected.
#
# We need to feed it our exploration policies. Furthermore, to run the policies from all groups as if they were one,
# we put them in a sequence. They will not interfere with each other as each group writes and reads keys in different places.
#

# Put exploration policies from each group in a sequence

# Conclusion and next steps
# -------------------------
#
# In this tutorial, we have seen:
#
# - How to create a competitive multi-group multi-agent environment in TorchRL, how its specs work, and how it integrates with the library;
# - How to create multi-agent network architectures in TorchRL for multiple groups;
# - How we can use :class:`tensordict.TensorDict` to carry multi-agent multi-group data;
# - How we can tie all the library components (collectors, modules, replay buffers, and losses) in a multi-agent multi-group MADDPG/IDDPG training loop.
#
# Now that you are proficient with multi-agent DDPG, you can check out all the TorchRL multi-agent implementations in the
# GitHub repository.
# These are code-only scripts of many MARL sota-implementations such as the ones seen in this tutorial,
# QMIX, MADDPG, IQL, and many more!
#
# Also do remember to check out our tutorial: :doc:`/tutorials/multiagent_ppo`.
#
# Finally, you can modify the parameters of this tutorial to try many other configurations and scenarios
# to become a MARL master.
#
# `PettingZoo <https://pettingzoo.farama.org/>`__ and VMAS contain many more scenarios.
# Here are a few videos of some possible scenarios you can try in VMAS.
