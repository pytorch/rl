# Tutorials

Get a sense of TorchRL functionalities through our tutorials.

For an overview of TorchRL, try the [TorchRL demo](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/torchrl_demo.html).

Make sure you test the [TensorDict tutorial](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/tensordict_tutorial.html) to see what TensorDict
is about and what it can do.

To understand how to use `TensorDict` with pytorch modules, make sure to check out the [TensorDictModule tutorial](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/tensordict_module.html).

Check out the [environment tutorial](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/torch_envs.html) for a deep dive in the envs
functionalities.

Read through our short tutorial on [multi-tasking](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/multi_task.html) to see how you can execute diverse
tasks in batch mode and build task-specific policies.
This tutorial is also a good example of the advanced features of TensorDict stacking and
indexing.

Finally, the [DDPG tutorial](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/coding_ddpg.html) and [DQN tutorial](https://pytorch.org/rl/tutorials/coding_dqn.html) will guide you through the steps to code 
your first RL algorithms with TorchRL.
