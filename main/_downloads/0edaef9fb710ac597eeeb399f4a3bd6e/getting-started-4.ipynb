        "The final chapter of this series before we orchestrate everything in a\ntraining script is to learn about logging.\n\n## Loggers\n\nLogging is crucial for reporting your results to the outside world and for\nyou to check that your algorithm is learning properly. TorchRL has several\nloggers that interface with custom backends such as\nwandb (:class:`~torchrl.record.loggers.wandb.WandbLogger`),\ntensorboard (:class:`~torchrl.record.loggers.tensorboard.TensorBoardLogger`) or a lightweight and\nportable CSV logger (:class:`~torchrl.record.loggers.csv.CSVLogger`) that you can use\npretty much everywhere.\n\nLoggers are located in the ``torchrl.record`` module and the various classes\ncan be found in the `API reference <ref_loggers>`.\n\nWe tried to keep the loggers APIs as similar as we could, given the\ndifferences in the underlying backends. While execution of the loggers will\nmostly be interchangeable, their instantiation can differ.\n\nUsually, building a logger requires\nat least an experiment name and possibly a logging directory and other\nhyperparameters.\n\n\n"

Some\nenvironments (e.g., Atari games) are already rendered as images whereas\nothers require you to create them as such. Fortunately, in most common cases,\nrendering and recording videos isn't too difficult.\n\nLet's first see how we can create a Gym environment that outputs images\nalongside its observations. :class:`~torchrl.envs.GymEnv` accept two keywords\nfor this purpose:\n- ``from_pixels=True`` will make the env ``step`` function\nwrite a ``\"pixels\"`` entry containing the images corresponding to your\nobservations, and\n\n- ``pixels_only=False`` will indicate that you want the\nobservations to be returned as well.\n\n\n"
