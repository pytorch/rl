        "If you are running this in Google Colab, make sure you install the following dependencies:\n\n```bash\n!pip3 install torchrl\n!pip3 install gym[mujoco]\n!pip3 install tqdm\n```\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy-gradient algorithm where a\nbatch of data is being collected and directly consumed to train the policy to maximise\nthe expected return given some proximality constraints. You can think of it\nas a sophisticated version of [REINFORCE](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992696.pdf),\nthe foundational policy-optimization algorithm. For more information, see the\n[Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) paper.\n\nPPO is usually regarded as a fast and efficient method for online, on-policy\nreinforcement algorithm. TorchRL provides a loss-module that does all the work\nfor you, so that you can rely on this implementation and focus on solving your\nproblem rather than re-inventing the wheel every time you want to train a policy.\n\nFor completeness, here is a brief overview of what the loss computes, even though\nthis is taken care of by our :class:`~torchrl.objectives.ClipPPOLoss` module\u2014the algorithm works as follows:\n1. we will sample a batch of data by playing the\npolicy in the environment for a given number of steps.\n2. Then, we will perform a given number of optimization steps with random sub-samples of this batch using\na clipped version of the REINFORCE loss.\n3. The clipping will put a pessimistic bound on our loss: lower return estimates will\nbe favored compared to higher ones.\nThe precise formula of the loss is:\n\n\\begin{align}L(s,a,\\theta_k,\\theta) = \\min\\left(\n    \\frac{\\pi_{\\theta}(a|s)}{\\pi_{\\theta_k}(a|s)}  A^{\\pi_{\\theta_k}}(s,a), \\;\\;\n    g(\\epsilon, A^{\\pi_{\\theta_k}}(s,a))\n    \\right),\\end{align}\n\nThere are two components in that loss: in the first part of the minimum operator,\nwe simply compute an importance-weighted version of the REINFORCE loss (for example, a\nREINFORCE loss that we have corrected for the fact that the current policy\nconfiguration lags the one that was used for the data collection).\nThe second part of that minimum operator is a similar loss where we have clipped\nthe ratios when they exceeded or were below a given pair of thresholds.\n\nThis loss ensures that whether the advantage is positive or negative, policy\nupdates that would produce significant shifts from the previous configuration\nare being discouraged.\n\nThis tutorial is structured as follows:\n\n1. First, we will define a set of hyperparameters we will be using for training.\n\n2. Next, we will focus on creating our environment, or simulator, using TorchRL's\n   wrappers and transforms.\n\n3. Next, we will design the policy network and the value model,\n   which is indispensable to the loss function. These modules will be used\n   to configure our loss module.\n\n4. Next, we will create the replay buffer and data loader.\n\n5. Finally, we will run our training loop and analyze the results.\n\nThroughout this tutorial, we'll be using the :mod:`tensordict` library.\n:class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` is the lingua franca of TorchRL: it helps us abstract\nwhat a module reads and writes and care less about the specific data\ndescription and more about the algorithm itself.\n\n\n"

        "There are a few things to notice in this code: first, we created\nthe environment by calling the ``GymEnv`` wrapper. If extra keyword arguments\nare passed, they will be transmitted to the ``gym.make`` method, hence covering\nthe most common environment construction commands.\nAlternatively, one could also directly create a gym environment using ``gym.make(env_name, **kwargs)``\nand wrap it in a `GymWrapper` class.\n\nAlso the ``device`` argument: for gym, this only controls the device where\ninput action and observed states will be stored, but the execution will always\nbe done on CPU. The reason for this is simply that gym does not support on-device\nexecution, unless specified otherwise. For other libraries, we have control over\nthe execution device and, as much as we can, we try to stay consistent in terms of\nstoring and execution backends.\n\n### Transforms\n\nWe will append some transforms to our environments to prepare the data for\nthe policy. In Gym, this is usually achieved via wrappers. TorchRL takes a different\napproach, more similar to other pytorch domain libraries, through the use of transforms.\nTo add transforms to an environment, one should simply wrap it in a :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.TransformedEnv`\ninstance and append the sequence of transforms to it. The transformed environment will inherit\nthe device and meta-data of the wrapped environment, and transform these depending on the sequence\nof transforms it contains.\n\n### Normalization\n\nThe first to encode is a normalization transform.\nAs a rule of thumbs, it is preferable to have data that loosely\nmatch a unit Gaussian distribution: to obtain this, we will\nrun a certain number of random steps in the environment and compute\nthe summary statistics of these observations.\n\nWe'll append two other transforms: the :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.DoubleToFloat` transform will\nconvert double entries to single-precision numbers, ready to be read by the\npolicy. The :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter` transform will be used to count the steps before\nthe environment is terminated. We will use this measure as a supplementary measure\nof performance.\n\nAs we will see later, many of the TorchRL's classes rely on :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict`\nto communicate. You could think of it as a python dictionary with some extra\ntensor features. In practice, this means that many modules we will be working\nwith need to be told what key to read (``in_keys``) and what key to write\n(``out_keys``) in the ``tensordict`` they will receive. Usually, if ``out_keys``\nis omitted, it is assumed that the ``in_keys`` entries will be updated\nin-place. For our transforms, the only entry we are interested in is referred\nto as ``\"observation\"`` and our transform layers will be told to modify this\nentry and this entry only:\n\n\n"

This means that our\nneural network will have to output the parameters of a distribution, rather\nthan a single value corresponding to the action taken.\n\nAs the data is continuous, we use a Tanh-Normal distribution to respect the\naction space boundaries.

        "## Data collector\n\nTorchRL provides a set of `DataCollector classes <ref_collectors>`.\nBriefly, these classes execute three operations: reset an environment,\ncompute an action given the latest observation, execute a step in the environment,\nand repeat the last two steps until the environment signals a stop (or reaches\na done state).\n\nThey allow you to control how many frames to collect at each iteration\n(through the ``frames_per_batch`` parameter),\nwhen to reset the environment (through the ``max_frames_per_traj`` argument),\non which ``device`` the policy should be executed, etc. They are also\ndesigned to work efficiently with batched and multiprocessed environments.\n\nThe simplest data collector is the :class:`~torchrl.collectors.SyncDataCollector`:\nit is an iterator that you can use to get batches of data of a given length, and\nthat will stop once a total number of frames (``total_frames``) have been\ncollected.\nOther data collectors (:class:`~torchrl.collectors.MultiSyncDataCollector` and\n:class:`~torchrl.collectors.MultiaSyncDataCollector`) will execute\nthe same operations in synchronous and asynchronous manner over a\nset of multiprocessed workers.\n\nAs for the policy and environment before, the data collector will return\n:class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` instances with a total number of elements that will\nmatch ``frames_per_batch``. Using :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` to pass data to the\ntraining loop allows you to write data loading pipelines\nthat are 100% oblivious to the actual specificities of the rollout content.\n\n\n"
