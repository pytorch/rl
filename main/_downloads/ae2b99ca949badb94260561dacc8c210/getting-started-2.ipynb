        "In TorchRL, we try to treat optimization as it is custom to do in PyTorch,\nusing dedicated loss modules which are designed with the sole purpose of\noptimizing the model. This approach efficiently decouples the execution of\nthe policy from its training and allows us to design training loops that are\nsimilar to what can be found in traditional supervised learning examples.\n\nThe typical training loop therefore looks like this:\n\n  ..code - block::Python\n\n    >>> for i in range(n_collections):\n    ...     data = get_next_batch(env, policy)\n    ...     for j in range(n_optim):\n    ...         loss = loss_fn(data)\n    ...         loss.backward()\n    ...         optim.step()\n\nIn this concise tutorial, you will receive a brief overview of the loss modules. Due to the typically\nstraightforward nature of the API for basic usage, this tutorial will be kept brief.\n\n## RL objective functions\n\nIn RL, innovation typically involves the exploration of novel methods\nfor optimizing a policy (i.e., new algorithms), rather than focusing\non new architectures, as seen in other domains. Within TorchRL,\nthese algorithms are encapsulated within loss modules. A loss\nmodule orchestrates the various components of your algorithm and\nyields a set of loss values that can be backpropagated\nthrough to train the corresponding components.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will take a popular\noff-policy algorithm as an example,\n[DDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971).\n\nTo build a loss module, the only thing one needs is a set of networks\ndefined as :class:`~tensordict.nn.TensorDictModule`s. Most of the time, one\nof these modules will be the policy. Other auxiliary networks such as\nQ-Value networks or critics of some kind may be needed as well. Let's see\nwhat this looks like in practice: DDPG requires a deterministic\nmap from the observation space to the action space as well as a value\nnetwork that predicts the value of a state-action pair. The DDPG loss will\nattempt to find the policy parameters that output actions that maximize the\nvalue for a given state.\n\nTo build the loss, we need both the actor and value networks.\nIf they are built according to DDPG's expectations, it is all\nwe need to get a trainable loss module:\n\n"

In\ngeneral, we make sure that only the loss values are differentiable such that\nyou can simply sum over the values of the dictionary to obtain the total\nloss.

        "## Further considerations: Target parameters\n\nAnother important aspect to consider is the presence of target parameters\nin off-policy algorithms like DDPG. Target parameters typically represent\na delayed or smoothed version of the parameters over time, and they play\na crucial role in value estimation during policy training. Utilizing target\nparameters for policy training often proves to be significantly more\nefficient compared to using the current configuration of value network\nparameters. Generally, managing target parameters is handled by the loss\nmodule, relieving users of direct concern. However, it remains the user's\nresponsibility to update these values as necessary based on specific\nrequirements. TorchRL offers a couple of updaters, namely\n:class:`~torchrl.objectives.HardUpdate` and\n:class:`~torchrl.objectives.SoftUpdate`,\nwhich can be easily instantiated without requiring in-depth\nknowledge of the underlying mechanisms of the loss module.\n\n\n"
