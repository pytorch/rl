        "## Exporting a TensorDictModule-based policy\n\n``TensorDict`` allowed us to build a policy with a great flexibility: from a regular :class:`~torch.nn.Module` that\noutputs action values from an observation, we added a :class:`~torchrl.modules.QValueModule` module that\nread these values and computed an action using some heuristic (e.g., an argmax call).\n\nHowever, there's a small technical catch in our case: the environment (the actual Atari game) doesn't return\ngrayscale, 84x84 images but raw screen-size color ones. The transforms we appended to the environment make sure that\nthe images can be read by the model. We can see that, from the training perspective, the boundary between environment\nand model is blurry, but at execution time things are much clearer: the model should take care of transforming\nthe input data (images) to the format that can be processed by our CNN.\n\nHere again, the magic of tensordict will unblock us: it happens that most of local (non-recursive) TorchRL's\ntransforms can be used both as environment transforms or preprocessing blocks within a :class:`~torch.nn.Module`\ninstance. Let's see how we can prepend them to our policy:\n\n"

If the policy is stochastic (e.g., the policy outputs a distribution over the action\nspace like it is the case in PPO or other similar on-policy algorithms) or explorative (with an exploration module\nappended like E-Greedy, additive gaussian or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck) we may want or not want to use that exploration\nstrategy in its exported version.\nFortunately, export utils can understand that context manager and as long as the exportation occurs within the right\ncontext manager, the behaviour of the policy should match what is indicated.

        "Note that ONNX also offers the possibility of optimizing models directly, but this is beyond the scope of this\ntutorial.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nIn this tutorial, we learned how to export TorchRL modules using various backends such as PyTorch's built-in export\nfunctionality, ``AOTInductor``, and ``ONNX``.\nWe demonstrated how to export a policy trained on an Atari game and run it on a pytorch-free setting using the ``ALE``\nlibrary. We also compared the performance of the original TorchRL instance with the exported ONNX model.\n\nKey takeaways:\n\n- Exporting TorchRL modules allows for deployment on devices without PyTorch installed.\n- AOTInductor and ONNX provide alternative backends for exporting models.\n- Optimizing ONNX models can improve performance.\n\nFurther reading and learning steps:\n\n- Check out the official documentation for PyTorch's [export functionality](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/export.html),\n  [AOTInductor](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/torch_export_aoti_python.html), and\n  [ONNX](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/onnx/intro_onnx.html) for more\n  information.\n- Experiment with deploying exported models on different devices.\n- Explore optimization techniques for ONNX models to improve performance.\n\n\n"
