        "If you are running this in Google Colab, make sure you install the following dependencies:\n\n```bash\n!pip3 install torchrl\n!pip3 install vmas\n!pip3 install tqdm\n```\nProximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is a policy-gradient algorithm where a\nbatch of data is being collected and directly consumed to train the policy to maximise\nthe expected return given some proximality constraints. You can think of it\nas a sophisticated version of [REINFORCE](https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00992696.pdf),\nthe foundational policy-optimization algorithm. For more information, see the\n[Proximal Policy Optimization Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.06347) paper.\n\nThis type of algorithms is usually trained *on-policy*. This means that, at every learning iteration, we have a\n**sampling** and a **training** phase. In the **sampling** phase of iteration $t$, rollouts are collected\nfrom agents' interactions in the environment using the current policies $\\mathbf{\\pi}_t$.\nIn the **training** phase, all the collected rollouts are immediately fed to the training process to perform\nbackpropagation. This leads to updated policies which are then used again for sampling.\nThe execution of this process in a loop constitutes *on-policy learning*.\n\n.. figure:: https://pytorch.s3.amazonaws.com/torchrl/github-artifacts/img/on_policy_vmas.png\n   :alt: On-policy learning\n\n   On-policy learning\n\n\nIn the training phase of the PPO algorithm, a *critic* is used to estimate the goodness of the actions\ntaken by the policy. The critic learns to approximate the value (mean discounted return) of a specific state.\nThe PPO loss then compares the actual return obtained by the policy to the one estimated by the critic to determine\nthe advantage of the action taken and guide the policy optimization.\n\nIn multi-agent settings, things are a bit different. We now have multiple policies $\\mathbf{\\pi}$,\none for each agent. Policies are typically local and decentralised. This means that\nthe policy for a single agent will output an action for that agent based only on its observation.\nIn the MARL literature, this is referred to as **decentralised execution**.\nOn the other hand, different formulations exist for the critic, mainly:\n\n- In [MAPPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.01955) the critic is centralised and takes as input the global state\n  of the system. This can be a global observation or simply the concatenation of the agents' observation. MAPPO\n  can be used in contexts where **centralised training** is performed as it needs access to global information.\n- In [IPPO](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.09533) the critic takes as input just the observation of the respective agent,\n  exactly like the policy. This allows **decentralised training** as both the critic and the policy will only need local\n  information to compute their outputs.\n\nCentralised critics help overcome the non-stationary of multiple agents learning concurrently, but,\non the other hand, they may be impacted by their large input space.\nIn this tutorial, we will be able to train both formulations, and we will also discuss how\nparameter-sharing (the practice of sharing the network parameters across the agents) impacts each.\n\nThis tutorial is structured as follows:\n\n1. First, we will define a set of hyperparameters we will be using.\n\n2. Next, we will create a vectorized multi-agent environment, using TorchRL's\n   wrapper for the VMAS simulator.\n\n3. Next, we will design the policy and the critic networks, discussing the impact of the various choices on\n   parameter sharing and critic centralization.\n\n4. Next, we will create the sampling collector and the replay buffer.\n\n5. Finally, we will run our training loop and analyse the results.\n\nIf you are running this in Colab or in a machine with a GUI, you will also have the option\nto render and visualise your own trained policy prior and after training.\n\nLet's import our dependencies\n\n\n"

It also means\nthat, when using it in TorchRL, both simulation and training can be run on-device, without ever passing\ndata to the CPU.\n\nThe multi-agent task we will solve today is *Navigation* (see animated figure above).\nIn *Navigation*, randomly spawned agents\n(circles with surrounding dots) need to navigate\nto randomly spawned goals (smaller circles).\nAgents need to use LIDARs (dots around them) to\navoid colliding into each other.\nAgents act in a 2D continuous world with drag and elastic collisions.\nTheir actions are 2D continuous forces which determine their acceleration.\nThe reward is composed of three terms: a collision penalization, a reward based on the distance to the goal, and a\nfinal shared reward given when all agents reach their goal.\nThe distance-based term is computed as the difference in the relative distance\nbetween an agent and its goal over two consecutive timesteps.\nEach agent observes its position,\nvelocity, lidar readings, and relative position to its goal.\n\nWe will now instantiate the environment.\nFor this tutorial, we will limit the episodes to ``max_steps``, after which the done flag is set. This is\nfunctionality is already provided in the VMAS simulator but the TorchRL :class:`~.envs.transforms.StepCount`\ntransform could alternatively be used.\nWe will also use ``num_vmas_envs`` vectorized environments, to leverage batch simulation.\n\n\n\n"

        "We can see that our rollout has ``batch_size`` of ``(num_vmas_envs, n_rollout_steps)``.\nThis means that all the tensors in it will have those leading dimensions.\n\nLooking more in depth, we can see that the output tensordict can be divided in the following way:\n\n- *In the root* (accessible by running ``rollout.exclude(\"next\")`` ) we will find all the keys that are available\n  after a reset is called at the first timestep. We can see their evolution through the rollout steps by indexing\n  the ``n_rollout_steps`` dimension. Among these keys, we will find the ones that are different for each agent\n  in the ``rollout[\"agents\"]`` tensordict, which will have batch size ``(num_vmas_envs, n_rollout_steps, n_agents)``\n  signifying that it is storing the additional agent dimension. The ones outside this agent tensordict\n  will be the shared ones (in this case only done).\n- *In the next* (accessible by running ``rollout.get(\"next\")`` ). We will find the same structure as the root,\n  but for keys that are available only after a step.\n\nIn TorchRL the convention is that done and observations will be present in both root and next (as these are\navailable both at reset time and after a step). Action will only be available in root (as there is no action\nresulting from a step) and reward will only be available in next (as there is no reward at reset time).\nThis structure follows the one in **Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton and Barto)** where root represents data at time $t$ and\nnext represents data at time $t+1$ of a world step.\n\n\n### Render a random rollout\n\nIf you are on Google Colab, or on a machine with OpenGL and a GUI, you can actually render a random rollout.\nThis will give you an idea of what a random policy will achieve in this task, in order to compare it\nwith the policy you will train yourself!\n\nTo render a rollout, follow the instructions in the *Render* section at the end of this tutorial\nand just remove the line ``policy=policy`` from ``env.rollout()`` .\n\n\n## Policy\n\nPPO utilises a stochastic policy to handle exploration. This means that our\nneural network will have to output the parameters of a distribution, rather\nthan a single value corresponding to the action taken.\n\nAs the data is continuous, we use a Tanh-Normal distribution to respect the\naction space boundaries. TorchRL provides such distribution, and the only\nthing we need to care about is to build a neural network that outputs the\nright number of parameters.\n\nIn this case, each agent's action will be represented by a 2-dimensional independent normal distribution.\nFor this, our neural network will have to output a mean and a standard deviation for each action.\nEach agent will thus have ``2 * n_actions_per_agents`` outputs.\n\nAnother important decision we need to make is whether we want our agents to **share the policy parameters**.\nOn the one hand, sharing parameters means that they will all share the same policy, which will allow them to benefit from\neach other's experiences. This will also result in faster training.\nOn the other hand, it will make them behaviorally *homogenous*, as they will in fact share the same model.\nFor this example, we will enable sharing as we do not mind the homogeneity and can benefit from the computational\nspeed, but it is important to always think about this decision in your own problems!\n\nWe design the policy in three steps.\n\n**First**: define a neural network ``n_obs_per_agent`` -> ``2 * n_actions_per_agents``\n\nFor this we use the ``MultiAgentMLP``, a TorchRL module made exactly for\nmultiple agents, with much customization available.\n\n\n"
