# Knowledge base

This knowledge base is aimed at helping you solving common issues that you might encounter on your RL journey.
It is a more practical guide than what one might usually gather from a textbook or a repo.
It details pro-tips to run models on cluster. It gives indications on how to set up a
conda environment, how to install packages without sudo access. It
highlights common issues when installing and running RL libraries and
provide ready-to-use solution for these issues.

## Contributing

Of course, this is a ever 1% complete journey, and we can't expect to cover all the RL
field at any point in the future.

**If you feel something is missing**, or if you bump in an issue and think that the
community might benefit from your experience, please submit a PR with your contribution!
