# Working with gym

## Versioning
TorchRL is tested against the latest version of gym and we only guarantee compatibility
against the gym version that was available at the time of release.

However, for specific projects we may be willing to work on keeping a backward 
compatibility with older versions of gym. 
If you run into an issue when running TorchRL with a specific version of gym, 
feel free to open an issue and we will gladly look into this.
