# Useful resources

## TorchRL paper
To know more about TorchRL philosophy, the problem it is trying to solve and
get some idea about its general capabilities, refer to the [TorchRL paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00577).

We also have some introductory videos for you to get to know the library better, check them out:
