This environment is part\nof a set called [MultiAgentParticleEnvironments (MPE)](https://github.com/openai/multiagent-particle-envs)_\nintroduced with the paper.\n\nThere are currently multiple simulators providing MPE environments.\nIn this tutorial we show how to train this environment in TorchRL using either:\n\n- [PettingZoo](https://pettingzoo.farama.org/)_, in the traditional CPU version of the environment;\n- [VMAS](https://github.com/proroklab/VectorizedMultiAgentSimulator)_, which provides a vectorized implementation in PyTorch,\n  able to simulate multiple environments on a GPU to speed up computation.\n\n.. figure:: https://github.com/matteobettini/vmas-media/blob/main/media/scenarios/simple_tag.gif?raw=true\n   :alt: Simple tag\n\n   Multi-agent *simple_tag* scenario\n\nKey learnings:\n\n- How to use competitive multi-agent environments in TorchRL, how their specs work, and how they integrate with the library;\n- How to use Parallel PettingZoo and VMAS environments with multiple agent groups in TorchRL;\n- How to create different multi-agent network architectures in TorchRL (e.g., using parameter sharing, centralised critic)\n- How we can use :class:`~tensordict.TensorDict` to carry multi-agent multi-group data;\n- How we can tie all the library components (collectors, modules, replay buffers, and losses) in an off-policy multi-agent MADDPG/IDDPG training loop.\n"

For more info on off-policy learning see\n*Sutton, Richard S., and Andrew G. Barto. Reinforcement learning: An introduction. MIT press, 2018*.\n\n.. figure:: https://pytorch.s3.amazonaws.com/torchrl/github-artifacts/img/off-policy-vmas-loop-min.png\n   :alt: Off-policy learning\n\n   Off-policy learning\n\nThis approach has been extended to multi-agent learning in [Multi-Agent Actor-Critic for Mixed Cooperative-Competitive Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275)_,\nwhich introduces the Multi Agent DDPG (MADDPG) algorithm.\nIn multi-agent settings, things are a bit different. We now have multiple policies $\\mathbf{\\pi}$,\none for each agent. Policies are typically local and decentralised. This means that\nthe policy for a single agent will output an action for that agent based only on its observation.\nIn the MARL literature, this is referred to as **decentralised execution**.\nOn the other hand, different formulations exist for the critic, mainly:\n\n- In [MADDPG](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.02275) the critic is centralised and takes as input the global state and global action\n  of the system. The global state can be a global observation or simply the concatenation of the agents' observation.\n  The global action is the concatenation of agent actions. MADDPG\n  can be used in contexts where **centralised training** is performed as it needs access to global information.\n- In IDDPG, the critic takes as input just the observation and action of one agent.\n  This allows **decentralised training** as both the critic and the policy will only need local\n  information to compute their outputs.\n\nCentralised critics help overcome the non-stationary of multiple agents learning concurrently, but,\non the other hand, they may be impacted by their large input space.\nIn this tutorial, we will be able to train both formulations, and we will also discuss how\nparameter-sharing (the practice of sharing the network parameters across the agents) impacts each.\n\nThe structure of this tutorial is as follows:\n\n1. Initially, we will establish a set of hyperparameters for use.\n\n2. Subsequently, we will construct a multi-agent environment, utilizing TorchRL's\n   wrapper for either PettingZoo or VMAS.\n\n3. Following that, we will formulate the policy and critic networks, discussing the effects of various choices on\n   parameter sharing and critic centralization.\n\n4. Afterwards, we will create the sampling collector and the replay buffer.\n\n5. In the end, we will execute our training loop and examine the outcomes.\n\nIf you are operating this in Colab or on a machine with a GUI, you will also have the opportunity\nto render and visualize your own trained policy before and after the training process.\n\nImport our dependencies:\n\n\n"

        "## Environment\n\nMulti-agent environments simulate multiple agents interacting with the world.\nTorchRL API allows integrating various types of multi-agent environment flavors.\nIn this tutorial we will focus on environments where multiple agent groups interact in parallel.\nThat is: at every step all agents will get an observation and take an action synchronously.\n\nFurthermore, the TorchRL MARL API allows to separate agents into groups. Each group will be a separate entry in the\ntensordict. The data of agents within a group is stacked together. Therefore, by choosing how to group your agents,\nyou can decide which data is stacked/kept as separate entries.\nThe grouping strategy can be specified at construction in environments like VMAS and PettingZoo.\nFor more info on grouping, see :class:`~torchrl.envs.utils.MarlGroupMapType`.\n\nIn the *simple_tag* environment\nthere are two teams of agents: the chasers (or \"adversaries\") (red circles) and the evaders (or \"agents\") (green circles).\nChasers are rewarded for touching evaders (+10).\nUpon a contact the team of chasers is collectively rewarded and the\nevader touched is penalized with the same value (-10).\nEvaders have higher speed and acceleration than chasers.\nIn the environment there are also obstacles (black circles).\nAgents and obstacles are spawned according to a uniform random distribution.\nAgents act in a 2D continuous world with drag and elastic collisions.\nTheir actions are 2D continuous forces which determine their acceleration.\nEach agent observes its position,\nvelocity, relative positions to all other agents and obstacles, and velocities of evaders.\n\nThe PettingZoo and VMAS versions differ slightly in the reward functions as PettingZoo penalizes evaders for going\nout-of-bounds, while VMAS impedes it physically. This is the reason why you will observe that in VMAS the rewards of the\ntwo teams are identical, just with opposite sign, while in PettingZoo the evaders will have lower rewards.\n\nWe will now instantiate the environment.\nFor this tutorial, we will limit the episodes to ``max_steps``, after which the terminated flag is set. This is\nfunctionality is already provided in the PettingZoo and VMAS simulators but the TorchRL :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.StepCounter`\ntransform could alternatively be used.\n\n\n"

        "We can see that our rollout has ``batch_size`` of ``(n_rollout_steps)``.\nThis means that all the tensors in it will have this leading dimension.\n\nLooking more in depth, we can see that the output tensordict can be divided in the following way:\n\n- *In the root* (accessible by running ``rollout.exclude(\"next\")`` ) we will find all the keys that are available\n  after a reset is called at the first timestep. We can see their evolution through the rollout steps by indexing\n  the ``n_rollout_steps`` dimension. Among these keys, we will find the ones that are different for each agent\n  in the ``rollout[group_name]`` tensordicts, which will have batch size ``(n_rollout_steps, n_agents_in_group)``\n  signifying that it is storing the additional agent dimension. The ones outside the group tensordicts\n  will be the shared ones.\n- *In the next* (accessible by running ``rollout.get(\"next\")`` ). We will find the same structure as the root with some minor differences highlighted below.\n\nIn TorchRL the convention is that done and observations will be present in both root and next (as these are\navailable both at reset time and after a step). Action will only be available in root (as there is no action\nresulting from a step) and reward will only be available in next (as there is no reward at reset time).\nThis structure follows the one in **Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (Sutton and Barto)** where root represents data at time $t$ and\nnext represents data at time $t+1$ of a world step.\n\n\n### Render a random rollout\n\nIf you are on Google Colab, or on a machine with OpenGL and a GUI, you can actually render a random rollout.\nThis will give you an idea of what a random policy will achieve in this task, in order to compare it\nwith the policy you will train yourself!\n\nTo render a rollout, follow the instructions in the *Render* section at the end of this tutorial\nand just remove the line ``policy=agents_exploration_policy`` from ``env.rollout()``.\n\n\n## Policy\n\nDDPG utilises a deterministic policy. This means that our\nneural network will output the action to take.\nAs the action is continuous, we use a Tanh-Delta distribution to respect the\naction space boundaries. The only thing that this class does is apply a Tanh transformation to make sure the action\nis withing the domain bounds.\n\nAnother important decision we need to make is whether we want the agents within a team to **share the policy parameters**.\nOn the one hand, sharing parameters means that they will all share the same policy, which will allow them to benefit from\neach other's experiences. This will also result in faster training.\nOn the other hand, it will make them behaviorally *homogenous*, as they will in fact share the same model.\nFor this example, we will enable sharing as we do not mind the homogeneity and can benefit from the computational\nspeed, but it is important to always think about this decision in your own problems!\n\nWe design the policy in three steps.\n\n**First**: define a neural network ``n_obs_per_agent`` -> ``n_actions_per_agents``\n\nFor this we use the ``MultiAgentMLP``, a TorchRL module made exactly for\nmultiple agents, with much customization available.\n\nWe will define a different policy for each group and store them in a dictionary.\n\n\n\n"

        "## Critic network\n\nThe critic network is a crucial component of the DDPG algorithm, even though it\nisn't used at sampling time. This module will read the observations & actions taken and\nreturn the corresponding value estimates.\n\nAs before, one should think carefully about the decision of **sharing the critic parameters** within an agent group.\nIn general, parameter sharing will grant faster training convergence, but there are a few important\nconsiderations to be made:\n\n- Sharing is not recommended when agents have different reward functions, as the critics will need to learn\n  to assign different values to the same state (e.g., in mixed cooperative-competitive settings).\n  In this case, since the two groups are already using separate networks, the sharing decision only applies\n  for agents within a group, which we already know have the same reward function.\n- In decentralised training settings, sharing cannot be performed without additional infrastructure to\n  synchronise parameters.\n\nIn all other cases where the reward function (to be differentiated from the reward) is the same for all agents\nin a group (as in the current scenario),\nsharing can provide improved performance. This can come at the cost of homogeneity in the agent strategies.\nIn general, the best way to know which choice is preferable is to quickly experiment both options.\n\nHere is also where we have to choose between **MADDPG and IDDPG**:\n\n- With MADDPG, we will obtain a central critic with full-observability\n  (i.e., it will take all the concatenated global agent observations and actions as input).\n  We can do this because we are in a simulator\n  and training is centralised.\n- With IDDPG, we will have a local decentralised critic, just like the policy.\n\nIn any case, the critic output will have shape ``(..., n_agents_in_group, 1)``.\nIf the critic is centralised and shared,\nall the values along the ``n_agents_in_group`` dimension will be identical.\n\nAs with the policy, we create a critic network for each group and store them in a dictionary.\n\n\n"
