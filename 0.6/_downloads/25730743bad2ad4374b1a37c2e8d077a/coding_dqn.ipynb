        "TorchRL provides a generic :class:`~torchrl.trainers.Trainer` class to handle\nyour training loop. The trainer executes a nested loop where the outer loop\nis the data collection and the inner loop consumes this data or some data\nretrieved from the replay buffer to train the model.\nAt various points in this training loop, hooks can be attached and executed at\ngiven intervals.\n\nIn this tutorial, we will be using the trainer class to train a DQN algorithm\nto solve the CartPole task from scratch.\n\nMain takeaways:\n\n- Building a trainer with its essential components: data collector, loss\n  module, replay buffer and optimizer.\n- Adding hooks to a trainer, such as loggers, target network updaters and such.\n\nThe trainer is fully customisable and offers a large set of functionalities.\nThe tutorial is organised around its construction.\nWe will be detailing how to build each of the components of the library first,\nand then put the pieces together using the :class:`~torchrl.trainers.Trainer`\nclass.\n\nAlong the road, we will also focus on some other aspects of the library:\n\n- how to build an environment in TorchRL, including transforms (e.g. data\n  normalization, frame concatenation, resizing and turning to grayscale)\n  and parallel execution. Unlike what we did in the\n  `DDPG tutorial <coding_ddpg>`, we\n  will normalize the pixels and not the state vector.\n- how to design a :class:`~torchrl.modules.QValueActor` object, i.e. an actor\n  that estimates the action values and picks up the action with the highest\n  estimated return;\n- how to collect data from your environment efficiently and store them\n  in a replay buffer;\n- how to use multi-step, a simple preprocessing step for off-policy algorithms;\n- and finally how to evaluate your model.\n\n**Prerequisites**: We encourage you to get familiar with torchrl through the\n`PPO tutorial <coding_ppo>` first.\n\n## DQN\n\nDQN ([Deep Q-Learning](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~vmnih/docs/dqn.pdf)) was\nthe founding work in deep reinforcement learning.\n\nOn a high level, the algorithm is quite simple: Q-learning consists in\nlearning a table of state-action values in such a way that, when\nencountering any particular state, we know which action to pick just by\nsearching for the one with the highest value. This simple setting\nrequires the actions and states to be\ndiscrete, otherwise a lookup table cannot be built.\n\nDQN uses a neural network that encodes a map from the state-action space to\na value (scalar) space, which amortizes the cost of storing and exploring all\nthe possible state-action combinations: if a state has not been seen in the\npast, we can still pass it in conjunction with the various actions available\nthrough our neural network and get an interpolated value for each of the\nactions available.\n\nWe will solve the classic control problem of the cart pole. From the\nGymnasium doc from where this environment is retrieved:\n\n| A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart, which moves along a\n| frictionless track. The pendulum is placed upright on the cart and the goal\n| is to balance the pole by applying forces in the left and right direction\n| on the cart.\n\n.. figure:: /_static/img/cartpole_demo.gif\n   :alt: Cart Pole\n\nWe do not aim at giving a SOTA implementation of the algorithm, but rather\nto provide a high-level illustration of TorchRL features in the context\nof this algorithm.\n\n"

        "Let's get started with the various pieces we need for our algorithm:\n\n- An environment;\n- A policy (and related modules that we group under the \"model\" umbrella);\n- A data collector, which makes the policy play in the environment and\n  delivers training data;\n- A replay buffer to store the training data;\n- A loss module, which computes the objective function to train our policy\n  to maximise the return;\n- An optimizer, which performs parameter updates based on our loss.\n\nAdditional modules include a logger, a recorder (executes the policy in\n\"eval\" mode) and a target network updater. With all these components into\nplace, it is easy to see how one could misplace or misuse one component in\nthe training script. The trainer is there to orchestrate everything for you!\n\n## Building the environment\n\nFirst let's write a helper function that will output an environment. As usual,\nthe \"raw\" environment may be too simple to be used in practice and we'll need\nsome data transformation to expose its output to the policy.\n\nWe will be using five transforms:\n\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.StepCounter` to count the number of steps in each trajectory;\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.ToTensorImage` will convert a ``[W, H, C]`` uint8\n  tensor in a floating point tensor in the ``[0, 1]`` space with shape\n  ``[C, W, H]``;\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.RewardScaling` to reduce the scale of the return;\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.GrayScale` will turn our image into grayscale;\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.Resize` will resize the image in a 64x64 format;\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.CatFrames` will concatenate an arbitrary number of\n  successive frames (``N=4``) in a single tensor along the channel dimension.\n  This is useful as a single image does not carry information about the\n  motion of the cartpole. Some memory about past observations and actions\n  is needed, either via a recurrent neural network or using a stack of\n  frames.\n- :class:`~torchrl.envs.transforms.ObservationNorm` which will normalize our observations\n  given some custom summary statistics.\n\nIn practice, our environment builder has two arguments:\n\n- ``parallel``: determines whether multiple environments have to be run in\n  parallel. We stack the transforms after the\n  :class:`~torchrl.envs.ParallelEnv` to take advantage\n  of vectorization of the operations on device, although this would\n  technically work with every single environment attached to its own set of\n  transforms.\n- ``obs_norm_sd`` will contain the normalizing constants for\n  the :class:`~torchrl.envs.ObservationNorm` transform.\n\n\n"

For asynchronous data\ncollectors such as ours, different storing devices mean that the data that\nwe collect won't sit on the same device each time, which is something that\nout training loop must account for.
