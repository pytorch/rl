class ServiceBase(ABC):
    """Base class for distributed service registries.

    A service registry manages distributed actors/services that can be accessed
    across multiple workers. Common use cases include:

    - Tokenizers shared across inference workers
    - Replay buffers for distributed training
    - Model registries for centralized model storage
    - Metrics aggregators

    The registry provides a dict-like interface for registering and accessing
    services by name.

        This method registers a service with the given name and immediately
        creates the corresponding actor. The service becomes globally visible
        to all workers in the cluster.

        Args:
            name: Unique identifier for the service. This name is used to
                retrieve the service later.
            service_factory: Class to instantiate as a remote actor.
            *args: Positional arguments to pass to the service constructor.
            **kwargs: Keyword arguments for both actor configuration and
                service constructor. Actor configuration options are backend-specific
                (e.g., num_cpus, num_gpus for Ray).

        Returns:
