"""vLLM weight synchronization for the v2 API.

This module provides weight synchronization for vLLM engines using a two-layer
architecture:

**Architecture Overview**

The weight synchronization uses two separate layers:

1. **RPC Layer** (Coordination)
   - Signals workers when a collective operation will begin
   - Can be implemented with different backends (Ray, torch.distributed.rpc, etc.)
   - Tells vLLM workers: "prepare to receive weights via collective"
   - Currently supports Ray as the RPC backend

2. **Collective Layer** (Data Transfer)
   - Performs the actual weight broadcast using NCCL
   - High-bandwidth GPU-to-GPU communication
   - All ranks participate simultaneously in the collective

**Why Two Layers?**

Separating RPC and collectives provides:
- **Flexibility**: Swap RPC backends (Ray, RPC, gRPC) without changing collectives
- **Clarity**: Coordination logic separate from data transfer
- **Performance**: Use optimal transport for each (RPC for signals, NCCL for data)

**Flow Example (Ray Backend)**

.. code-block::

    Trainer (rank 0)                    vLLM Workers (ranks 1+)
    ================                    =======================

    # 1. RPC: Signal collective start
    trainer.update_weights() ---------> [Ray RPC] --------> receiver.init_all_workers_group()
                                                            "I'm ready for collective"

    # 2. Collective: Broadcast weights
    NCCL broadcast -------------------- [GPU-GPU] ---------> NCCL receive
    (high bandwidth)                                        (parallel)

    # 3. RPC: Confirmation (optional)
    "broadcast done" <----------------- [Ray RPC] --------- "weights applied"

**Extending to Other Backends**

To add a new RPC backend (e.g., torch.distributed.rpc):

1. Implement an RPC coordinator in the sender/receiver
2. Replace Ray remote calls with your RPC mechanism
3. Keep the collective layer unchanged (it's backend-agnostic)

.. rubric:: Example

.. code-block:: python

    class TorchRPCVLLMReceiver(VLLMWeightReceiver):
        def init_all_workers_group(self, metadata):
            # Use torch.distributed.rpc instead of Ray
            torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_sync(
                "trainer",
                lambda: "ready",
            )
            super().init_all_workers_group(metadata)  # Collective init

**Current Implementation (Ray Backend)**

The test suite in ``test_weightsync.py`` demonstrates the Ray-based RPC:

.. code-block:: python

    # Trainer actor (provides RPC endpoint)
    trainer = RayWorkerTransformer.as_remote().options(
        name="Trainer"  # Named for discovery
    ).remote(scheme_config)

    # Receiver actor (uses RPC to coordinate)
    receiver = RayWorkerVLLM.as_remote().remote(
        scheme_config, trainer_actor_name="Trainer"
    )

    # RPC Layer: Both actors call init() via Ray remote calls
    # This coordinates the collective handshake
    ray.get([trainer.init.remote(), receiver.init.remote()])

    # RPC Layer: Trigger update via Ray remote call
    # Collective Layer: NCCL broadcast happens automatically
    ray.get(trainer.update_weights.remote(modify_weights=True))

In this setup:
- **Ray provides RPC**: Named actors, ``remote()`` calls, ``ray.get()``
- **NCCL provides collectives**: GPU-GPU weight broadcast
- **Loose coupling**: Can replace Ray with any RPC mechanism

class VLLMWeightSyncScheme(WeightSyncScheme):
    """Weight synchronization scheme for vLLM engines.

    This scheme uses collective communication (NCCL) to broadcast weights from
    a trainer to vLLM inference workers with parallelism support.

    Args:
        master_address: Address of the master node. Defaults to "localhost".
        master_port: Port of the master node. If None, will auto-assign.
        gpus_per_replica: Number of GPUs per replica (tp_size × dp_size × pp_size).
        num_replicas: Number of vLLM engine replicas. Defaults to 1.
        strategy: Weight extraction strategy ("tensordict" or "state_dict").
        device: Device index to use for communication. Defaults to 0.
            Note: When using Ray, each actor sees only its assigned GPU as device 0
            due to CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES isolation. You should typically use 0.

    .. warning::
        Collective communication requires ALL ranks to participate simultaneously.
        Both the sender (trainer, rank 0) and all receivers (vLLM workers, ranks 1+)
        must call ``init_all_workers_group()`` at approximately the same time for the collective
        handshake to succeed. Do NOT wait for one init to complete before starting
        the other - start both and wait for both together.

    Note:
        The world_size for NCCL will be: 1 (trainer) + num_replicas × gpus_per_replica (vLLM workers)

    **RPC + Collective Implementation**

    This class implements both layers:

    1. **RPC Layer**: Currently uses Ray for coordination
       - `init()` in test uses Ray `ray.get_actor()` to find trainer
       - Fetches metadata via Ray remote call
       - Signals readiness to participate in collective

    2. **Collective Layer**: Participates in NCCL broadcast
       - Receives weights via collective operations
       - vLLM engine applies weights internally during broadcast

    **Extending RPC Backends**

    To use a different RPC backend:

    .. code-block:: python

        class TorchRPCVLLMReceiver(VLLMWeightReceiver):
            def init(self):
                # Custom RPC: Get metadata from trainer
                metadata = torch.distributed.rpc.rpc_sync(
                    "trainer",
                    lambda: get_metadata()
                )

                # Then init collective (unchanged)
                self.receiver.init_all_workers_group(metadata)

    Note:
        The RPC and collective layers are loosely coupled. The RPC layer
        ensures all ranks are ready before the collective starts, but the
        actual data transfer is independent of the RPC mechanism.
