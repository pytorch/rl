"""vLLM weight synchronization using double-buffered shared memory.

This module provides weight synchronization for vLLM engines using a double-buffer
approach with memory-mapped TensorDict storage.

**Architecture Overview**

The double-buffer synchronization uses a simpler architecture compared to NCCL:

1. **Sender (Trainer)**
   - Extracts weights from the training model
   - Writes weights to shared directory using TensorDict.memmap
   - No coordination needed - receiver pulls when ready

2. **Receiver (vLLM Worker)**
   - Uses RPC to tell all vLLM workers to load from shared directory
   - Each worker reads weights and calls model.load_weights()
   - Can trigger at any time (pull-based)

**Key Differences from NCCL**

- **Async vs Sync**: Double-buffer is asynchronous (no coordination required)
- **Push vs Pull**: Sender writes, receiver pulls when ready via RPC
- **Simplicity**: No NCCL collectives, uses file I/O
- **Storage**: Uses shared filesystem instead of GPU-GPU transfer

**RPC Pattern**

Like the NCCL implementation, this uses RPC to coordinate workers:
- RPC tells workers: "load weights from this directory"
- Workers read from shared storage independently
- Each worker calls `model_runner.model.load_weights()`

**Usage Example**

.. code-block:: python

    # Create scheme with shared directory
    scheme = VLLMDoubleBufferSyncScheme(
        remote_addr="/shared/weights",
        num_threads=4
    )

    # Sender side (trainer)
    sender = scheme.create_sender()
    sender.register_model(policy_model)
    sender.update_weights()  # Writes to /shared/weights

    # Receiver side (vLLM worker - AsyncVLLM)
    receiver = scheme.create_receiver(vllm_engine)
    receiver.poll_and_apply()  # RPC to workers -> load from /shared/weights

**Node-to-Node Transfer**

For distributed setups, you can use different addresses:
- Sender writes to local path
- Use NFS, rsync, or other file sync mechanisms
- Receiver reads from its local mount point
