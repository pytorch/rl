        "Welcome to the getting started tutorials!\n\nBelow is the list of the topics we will be covering.\n\n- `Environments, TED and transforms <gs_env_ted>`;\n- `TorchRL's modules <gs_modules>`;\n- `Losses and optimization <gs_optim>`;\n- `Data collection and storage <gs_storage>`;\n- `TorchRL's logging API <gs_logging>`.\n\nIf you are in a hurry, you can jump straight away to the last tutorial,\n`Your own first training loop <gs_first_training>`, from where you can\nbacktrack every other \"Getting Started\" tutorial if things are not clear or\nif you want to learn more about a specific topic!\n\n## Environments in RL\n\nThe standard RL (Reinforcement Learning) training loop involves a model,\nalso known as a policy, which is trained to accomplish a task within a\nspecific environment. Often, this environment is a simulator that accepts\nactions as input and produces an observation along with some metadata as\noutput.\n\nIn this document, we will explore the environment API of TorchRL: we will\nlearn how to create an environment, interact with it, and understand the\ndata format it uses.\n\n## Creating an environment\n\nIn essence, TorchRL does not directly provide environments, but instead\noffers wrappers for other libraries that encapsulate the simulators. The\n:mod:`~torchrl.envs` module can be viewed as a provider for a generic\nenvironment API, as well as a central hub for simulation backends like\n[gym](https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.01540) (:class:`~torchrl.envs.GymEnv`),\n[Brax](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.13281) (:class:`~torchrl.envs.BraxEnv`)\nor [DeepMind Control Suite](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.00690)\n(:class:`~torchrl.envs.DMControlEnv`).\n\nCreating your environment is typically as straightforward as the underlying\nbackend API allows. Here's an example using gym:\n\n"

As our function\nsignatures are very generic, it eliminates the challenge of accommodating\ndifferent data formats. In simpler terms, after this brief tutorial,\nyou will be capable of operating on both simple and highly complex\nenvironments, as their user-facing API is identical and simple!\n\nLet's put the environment into action and see what a tensordict instance\nlooks like:\n\n"

If a policy is available, it can\nbe passed to the method and used to collect data.\n\nNevertheless, it can useful to run a naive, policyless rollout at first to\ncheck what is to be expected from an environment at a glance.\n\nTo appreciate the versatility of TorchRL's API, consider the fact that the\nrollout method is universally applicable.
