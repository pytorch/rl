        "Replay buffers are a central piece of any RL or control algorithm.\nSupervised learning methods are usually characterized by a training loop\nwhere data is randomly pulled from a static dataset and fed successively\nto the model and loss function.\nIn RL, things are often slightly different: the data is gathered using the\nmodel, then temporarily stored in a dynamic structure (the experience\nreplay buffer), which serves as dataset for the loss module.\n\nAs always, the context in which the buffer is used drastically conditions\nhow it is built: some may wish to store trajectories when others will want\nto store single transitions. Specific sampling strategies may be preferable\nin contexts: some items can have a higher priority than others, or it can\nbe important to sample with or without replacement.\nComputational factors may also come into play, such as the size of the buffer\nwhich may exceed the available RAM storage.\n\nFor these reasons, TorchRL's replay buffers are fully composable: although\nthey come with \"batteries included\", requiring a minimal effort to be built,\nthey also support many customizations such as storage type,\nsampling strategy or data transforms.\n\n\nIn this tutorial, you will learn:\n\n- How to build a `Replay Buffer (RB) <tuto_rb_vanilla>` and use it with\n  any datatype;\n- How to customize the `buffer's storage <tuto_rb_storage>`;\n- How to use `RBs with TensorDict <tuto_rb_td>`;\n- How to `sample from or iterate over a replay buffer <tuto_rb_sampling>`,\n  and how to define the sampling strategy;\n- How to use `prioritized replay buffers <tuto_rb_prb>`;\n- How to `transform data <tuto_rb_transform>` coming in and out from\n  the buffer;\n- How to store `trajectories <tuto_rb_traj>` in the buffer.\n\n\n## Basics: building a vanilla replay buffer\n\n\nTorchRL's replay buffers are designed to prioritize modularity,\ncomposability, efficiency, and simplicity. For instance, creating a basic\nreplay buffer is a straightforward process, as shown in the following\nexample:\n\n\n"

        "We have used the :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.extend` method which is\ndesigned to add multiple items all at once. If the object that is passed\nto ``extend`` has more than one dimension, its first dimension is\nconsidered to be the one to be split in separate elements in the buffer.\n\nThis essentially means that when adding multidimensional tensors or\ntensordicts to the buffer, the buffer will only look at the first dimension\nwhen counting the elements it holds in memory.\nIf the object passed it not iterable, an exception will be thrown.\n\nTo add items one at a time, the :meth:`~torchrl.data.ReplayBuffer.add` method\nshould be used instead.\n\n## Customizing the storage\n\n\nWe see that the buffer has been capped to the first 1000 elements that we\npassed to it.\nTo change the size, we need to customize our storage.\n\nTorchRL proposes three types of storages:\n\n- The :class:`~torchrl.data.ListStorage` stores elements independently in a\n  list. It supports any data type, but this flexibility comes at the cost\n  of efficiency;\n- The :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyTensorStorage` stores tensors data\n  structures contiguously.\n  It works naturally with :class:`~tensordidct.TensorDict`\n  (or :class:`~torchrl.data.tensorclass`)\n  objects. The storage is contiguous on a per-tensor basis, meaning that\n  sampling will be more efficient than when using a list, but the\n  implicit restriction is that any data passed to it must have the same\n  basic properties (such as shape and dtype) as the first batch of data that\n  was used to instantiate the buffer.\n  Passing data that does not match this requirement will either raise an\n  exception or lead to some undefined behaviors.\n- The :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyMemmapStorage` works as the\n  :class:`~torchrl.data.LazyTensorStorage` in that it is lazy (i.e., it\n  expects the first batch of data to be instantiated), and it requires data\n  that match in shape and dtype for each batch stored. What makes this\n  storage unique is that it points to disk files (or uses the filesystem\n  storage), meaning that it can support very large datasets while still\n  accessing data in a contiguous manner.\n\nLet us see how we can use each of these storages:\n\n"
